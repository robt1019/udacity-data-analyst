main Questions
    what factors are linked to surviving the sinking of titanic

    general aims
        avoid analysis on anything with impractically low base sizes

todo:
    try doing some standardizing etc. vectorized operations of some sort
        maybe do grouping to make separate df type objects then combine them
        family analysis could be good for vectorized operations

wrangling
    change column names
    remove na from ages
    bin age data


things i can use to analyse things

    pearsons r for correlation between linear values - actually not sure it makes sense to use this for the data here as it's binary
    as in survived or died so a bit different

Questions to answer:
    Who likely to survive

        Being part of a family/size of family vs survival

        Class - find correlation between this 
           seems to be a link between being higher up the socio-economic ladder findand not dying 

        Gender - 
            first impressions. Definitely good to be a lady if you don't want to die on the Titanic

        Age 
            very young (0-18) and (30-40) survived more. Would be good to combine this with gender
                Then -> combination of above factors
