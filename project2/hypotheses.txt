    need to figure out how to properly bin age data. Split between base sizes nice and neatly
        done

wrangling
    change column names
    remove na from ages
    bin age data


things i can use to analyse things

    pearsons r for correlation between linear values - actually not sure it makes sense to use this for the data here as it's binary
    as in survived or died so a bit different

Questions to answer:
    Who likely to survive

        Being part of a family/size of family vs survival

        Class - find correlation between this 
           seems to be a link between being higher up the socio-economic ladder findand not dying 

        Gender - 
            first impressions. Definitely good to be a lady if you don't want to die on the Titanic

        Age 
            very young (0-18) and (30-40) survived more. Would be good to combine this with gender
                Then -> combination of above factors
