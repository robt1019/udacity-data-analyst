    change column names


things i can use to analyse things

    pearsons r for correlation between linear values - actually not sure it makes sense to use this for the data here as it's binary
    as in survived or died so a bit different

Questions to answer:
    Who likely to survive

        Being part of a family/size of family vs survival

        Class - find correlation between this and survival using Pearson's R
           seems to be a link between being higher up the socio-economic ladder findand not dying 

        Gender - 

            first impressions. Definitely good to be a lady if you don't want to die on the Titani

        Age 



            Then -> combination of above factors
