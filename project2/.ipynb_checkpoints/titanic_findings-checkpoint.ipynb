    "* **Change column names** - This was largely just to make the data more intuitive to work with for me.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Binning age data**. I felt the need to do this to allow me to look at how people in different age brackets fared with regards to survival. Here I used the pandas `qcut` method to split the data by age into equal sized bins. This yielded the following bin definitions: `[ 0.42,  19.  ,  25.  ,  31.8 ,  41.  ,  80.  ]`. From this I could tell that the youngest in the sample was 0.42, and the oldest was 80. I decided based on these definitions to add a column to the dataframe called `age_binned`, with passengers divided as follows: `['0-18', '18-25','25-30', '30-40', '40-80']`\n",
